# eInkImageFrame

This is my eInkImageFrame for an inkplate 10.

I'm trying to make this as easy to use as a Nixplay device.

The application consists of a few parts:

## [firmware](firmaware/README)

The firmware for the application, this runs on the inkplate.

## [hardware](hardware/README)

The hardware (enclosure) for the plate and associated buttons, power, etc.

## [application](application/README)

The application files, a simple web UI for managing the images.
